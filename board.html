                                <p>Dave oversees township operations with the same dedication he brings to cheering on the Chicago White Sox! When he's not busy maintaining our rural community's character, you'll find him passionately defending the South Side's finest baseball team with statistics dating back to 1901. Dave believes in fiscal responsibility, transparent government, and that the White Sox will absolutely win the World Series again (just you wait!). His office is rumored to have more White Sox memorabilia than township ordinances, and residents have learned that scheduling meetings during playoff season requires extra patience. Despite his unwavering loyalty to a team that regularly breaks hearts, Dave channels that same optimistic determination into making Colfax Township the best place to live in Oceana County!</p>
